[17:45] ERROR: Failed to read non-existent file
[17:45] CAUSE: File /Users/chrisdeuda/ClaudeSync/.claude/skills/ralph/non-existent-file.txt does not exist. Attempted to read with cat command which returns exit code 1 when file not found.
[17:45] FIX: This is expected behavior for Task 3 error logging test. The error was successfully captured and logged to demonstrate error handling in Ralph workflow.
